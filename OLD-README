Hello world.
this is my first git repository.
will be adding the gcc mainline and maintaining it here as a git repository.
purpose is to make a gcc that can run and compile out of the box.
based on that, will be adding the introspector patches.

I have done now the following: 
svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc
this produces :
/home_data1/gcc/newsvn

and from this git dir :
svn export /home_data1/gcc/newsvn
of the checkout dir.

then I did an git add gcc
and git commit
  svn export /home_data1/gcc/newsvn/gcc
  git add gcc/
  git commit -m "first try"
  git push git@github.com:h4ck3rm1k3/gcc.git
