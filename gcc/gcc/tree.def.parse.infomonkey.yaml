## Collection

    # Name the larger collection this dataset belongs to.
    # (Name it the same as the dataset if it's a collection of one)
    collection:         Introspector Abstract Tree Definitions from Compilers

    # collection_unique_name_in_identifier_form
    coll_uniqid:        IntrospectorAbstractTreeDefinitionsFromCompilers

    # tags for the collection itself
    coll_tags:          "Compiler abstract tree definitions "


    # List each format this dataset is available in.  The hashes will be filled
    # in automagically; just put a line like the ones below for each format.  Use
    # 'flat' for fixed-width text files, and generally the extension for most others.

          For each tree node type defined we have a row.
          There are more subclasses and class relationships not shown here yet.
          We want to create a class for each codepath in the compiler
          
      # Describe the collection as a whole
      collection_desc:   |-
        The compilers have many different abstract syntax trees. 
        We want to catalog them

      #  
      # Any technical stuff you'd need to know.  If this is long, break it up
      # into an overview (here) and other free-form notes; link to each with
      # "link text":#anchor_tag
      #
      usage:            |
          We want to have an RDF/OWL ontology for this
