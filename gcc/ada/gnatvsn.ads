--  This package spec exports version information for GNAT, GNATBIND and
--  GNATMAKE.

package Gnatvsn is

   Gnat_Static_Version_String : constant String := "GNU Ada";
   --  Static string identifying this version, that can be used as an argument
   --  to e.g. pragma Ident.

   function Gnat_Version_String return String;
   --  Version output when GNAT (compiler), or its related tools, including
   --  GNATBIND, GNATCHOP, GNATFIND, GNATLINK, GNATMAKE, GNATXREF, are run
   --  (with appropriate verbose option switch set).

   type Gnat_Build_Type is (FSF, GPL);
   --  See Build_Type below for the meaning of these values.

   Build_Type : constant Gnat_Build_Type := FSF;
   --  Kind of GNAT build:
   --
   --    FSF
   --       GNAT FSF version. This version of GNAT is part of a Free Software
   --       Foundation release of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The bug
   --       box generated by Comperr gives information on how to report bugs
   --       and list the "no warranty" information.
   --
   --    GPL
   --       GNAT GPL Edition. This is a special version of GNAT, released by
   --       Ada Core Technologies and intended for academic users, and free
   --       software developers. The bug box generated by the package Comperr
   --       gives appropriate bug submission instructions that do not reference
   --       customer number etc.

   function Gnat_Free_Software return String;
   --  Text to be displayed by the different GNAT tools when switch --version
   --  is used. This text depends on the GNAT build type.

   function Copyright_Holder return String;
   --  Return the name of the Copyright holder to be displayed by the different
   --  GNAT tools when switch --version is used.

   Ver_Len_Max : constant := 64;
   --  Longest possible length for Gnat_Version_String in this or any
   --  other version of GNAT. This is used by the binder to establish
   --  space to store any possible version string value for checks. This
   --  value should never be decreased in the future, but it would be
   --  OK to increase it if absolutely necessary.

   Library_Version : constant String := "4.4";
   --  Library version. This value must be updated whenever any change to the
   --  compiler affects the library formats in such a way as to obsolete
   --  previously compiled library modules.
   --
   --  Note: Makefile.in relies on the precise format of the library version
   --  string in order to correctly construct the soname value.

   Verbose_Library_Version : constant String := "GNAT Lib v" & Library_Version;
   --  Version string stored in e.g. ALI files.

   Current_Year : constant String := "2008";
   --  Used in printing copyright messages

end Gnatvsn;
